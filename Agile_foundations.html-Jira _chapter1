Agile foundations Topic:

1)Earlier in traditional planning first is to plan the project, next execute the project ,then test the project and at last finalize the project 
but all these don't work simultaneously as all works in a sequential manner.

2) Agile manifesto considered as 4 values and 12 principles. 4 values are:
i) individuals and interaction
ii) working software
iii)customer collaboration
iv) responding to change.

12 principles of agile manifesto are:
principle 1:Prioritize high value work-product owner will work with the team to simplify functionality into something that can be delivered into 
short sprint.
principle 2: welcoming change - when you work in your cone of uncertainity.
principle 3:Contionus delivery as a measure of progress - that's why most agile team deliver in short iterations called as sprints.
principle 4:developers and customers work closely together- product owner who is also product representative , sits with the team and guide them on
product.
principle 5: small , motivated, self-organized team of generalists-that's why most agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized, 
work together to deliver the project.
principle 6: importance of face to face interaction, that' why most agile teams write user stories instead of writing long documents.
principle 7:Contionus delivery as a measure of progress.
principle 8:Prioritize high value work
principle 9:Prioritize high value work
principle 10: Prioritize high value work
principle 11: small , motivated, self-organized team of generalists 
principle 12: frequently discuss process improvements.

3) why multitasking : team members gets distributed frequently when they starting working on one thing due to the entry of another thing, 
to avoid multitasking , agile comes into picture, so agile principle is to deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to months,
with a prefernce to shoter time-frame known as "sprints".
Reducing multitasking is idea behind agile framewrok called "scrum".
