--> Jira INTRODUCTION :It is a software taht assist , tracking, reporting of project , developed by atlassian , initially started as software devlopement tool to support agile , mostly for software development teams, last few yrs adopted by all industries. it can be categorized into 3 category  as jira software ( software development and agile teams), jira service desk (IT serviec desk like helpdesk in which users raise service request and have SLA etc) , jira core (business units , highly customizable as screens and can modify roles and responsibilities of persons, if working in any HR or marketing then JIRA core will be used).

--> Issues in JIRA: issue is any task want to achieve , in order to complete a particular project . In JIRA issue is a task that team complete in order to deliver the project. Default issue types (supported would be bug, story bug task etc), JIRA core( have different task ).
if we click on all issues and after that click on create then in type option can see option such as epic, initiative, bug, story, task and if use JIRA CORE then it only show as task or sub task options.can also create sub task when choose epic, story, bug , if u use JIRA service desk then u can only select service request, incident, change management, problem management option in a issue option. custom/default  issue type created by JIRA admin .

--> how to customize view of certain issues in JIRA or add / remove columns of serach results in issues : if I click on JQL from basic (in basic there is no quesry all dashboard but in JQL u can write quesy like- type = Bug AND project = FP AND assignee = currentUser() ORDER BY created DESC) 

--> JIRA homepage-first page in when u login into JIRA, various options shown on homepage is :
1) first option available is Dashboards: its hows two options further as view all dashboard or to create it.copy dashboard or can share dashboard by clciking on three dots after choosing dashboard option.
2) Projects : in which can see all the projects made list and also option to create that project.
3) Filters : there are 2options view all issues, and view all filters.
4) Boards: in view all borads and recent boards options, bu clciking on any board it show the progress.
5) one additional plugin is tehre if download Zephyr test managementand execution plugin into JIRA software , test tab allows to manage eg , execution cycle, creating test cases, checking tracebeility etc.
6) create button : is used to create any issue type in project and then issue type selecting , summary fields hav provided and then clcik on create .
7)search bar : this is used to search issue fast.
8) settings tab :in which altlassian admin can add users and manage their roles.
9) In profile section can change password, name , language and preferences.


--> JIRA Gadgets : they displays summaries of JIRA project and issue data on JIRA Dashboard, so as when new dashboard rather than default dashboard is created then after creating new dashboard , option of adding gadgets appear in which can choose like bubble chart etc and can link with the project details and that gadjet will show summaries details of JIRA project .

--> JIRA Atlassian Marketplace : how can manage addons in JIRA software - to discover atlassian marketplace click on jira settings options and in taht choose APPS clcik on aaps and then on search bar can find all the external tools instance which can be downloaded in JIRA , for eg I installed Zephyr instance and after installation can look into manage apps and if wanted to uninstall then can disable or totally uninstall it by clciking on magae apps only.

--> JIRA projects: 1)jira prject is a collection of issues , single place to manage ur work. 
2) every project in JIRA has workflow .
3) teams use project to manage software delivery .
4) 3 jira applications are jira software, jira helpdesk, jira core and like development of new soft. applications, hr-employee onboarding or finance use jira core , jira service desk -it help desk like service request.
5) in jira we use , users -team members, issues-task/ bug story, workflow-process for each task, version / realease- specific to development efforts and released to production, components- like database /ui , data for reporting on prject status,  


--> KANBAN software - it si a framework for agile development methodology and JIRA supports 2 types of framework one is scrum ad KANBAN , it is much more suited when there is contionous flow of work , instead of time box iterations like scrum methodology like scrum , gives flexilibility like of continous delivery , advantage is change can happen anytime , so reprioritization or change of issues can happen anytime in KANBAN,it is most suited when there is no rigid timeline .

--> diff b/w scrum and KANBAN :
Kanban and Scrum are both project management frameworks, but they differ in how they manage work and how they approach decision making: 
1) Workflow
Kanban uses a continuous workflow, while Scrum uses structured sprints. 
2) Task management
Kanban breaks down tasks into smaller chunks, while Scrum focuses on specific tasks during sprints. 
3) Decision making
Kanban uses a simple process of defining goals, mapping processes, creating cards, and setting limits. Scrum uses collaborative, team-based approaches, with key decisions made during meetings. 
4) Prioritization
Scrum prioritizes work by sorting and grooming the product backlog, setting priorities, and estimating resources. Kanban uses probabilistic forecasting instead of a prioritization or estimation scheme. 
5) Best use
Kanban is better for smaller projects or ongoing projects with small pieces of work, while Scrum is better for complex projects that need to be split into smaller chunks. 
6) Kanban can be used to supplement Scrum, or you can use a mixture of the two approaches called Scrumban.


--> jira project creation -in project creation , there is one option to import data into jira- only jira administrator can create new project . 

--> how to edit/delete project in JIRA- only accessible to jira administrator -click on the settings button on dashboard and then clcik on th eproject you want to delete or modify , if want to modify details then clcik on threee dots and go into project settings and can modify the name and clcik save, if want to delete then clcik on three dots and clcik on move to trash , it ask for password and after that it will be deleted.


--> Epic in JIra : its is an issue of type epic in jira with which other issues like user stories, bugs, tasks can be linked , only available in jira software not in other, it contain large work so it can also considered as large user story or requirement which is further broken down into  user stories, and us are the requirements which can be delivered in sprint , so any requirement deliver within sprint is user story or anything which is bigger than us or take multiple sprints is known as epic , to create epic click on create option and then choose project name and issue type as epic and at last click on create , based on the delivery of us we can track the completion of epic .
when one epic is created then according to the points mentioned in description will make all different us for each point. in label part we can paste any image or any logo in label , in adding we can attach a child issue means any us , bug ., can add the start date and end date of any duration like i add for 3 months time period. there are soo many options available in epic to serach like status category of to do , in progress and done .


--> Story in JIRA - story is a small term requirement , or short term goal, in which we complete before the sprint completion, story is always less than epic. story is epic's child .
to create a story clcik on backlog and in that create an issue choose story , while  creating story have to wwrite all the names , description and then comes story point estimate which is very imp , in which some people made it in hour basis or day basis or half day basis for eg in my story point estimate i take 12 hours time period, can also attach some documents. after story made can see it in backlog. there is no compulsory to add story with epic but 95%time we add it . 
we can add epic with story by clciking on edit option present on top of story. can also create child issue with story so that until child issue or sub task does not complete story can't be completed.can also move from story to epic or vice-versa that is if by mistake we make story and need to made epic then we can make it in move it by clciking on move option 

the main difference b/w task and story is that on story more than one people can work but in task only one people will work.


--> sprint in JIRA: when in small time frame we try to develop features of project , it is always less than 1 yr , we divide project into small small parts,  when creting sprint go into backlog and click on creat esprint option then , can add any story /bug/issue in sprint, can make multiple sprints also , to edit or cange date of sprint use custom option/ duration such as 1 /2/3/4 weeks , until and unless sprint 1 is over if we already made sprint 2 , it won't reflect in board only sprint 1 task such as story, bug will be shown in to do / in progress/ done column . when we complete first sprint then only sprint 2 will be visible in board and remaining task of sprint 1 will be automatically  shifted in sprint 2 .
