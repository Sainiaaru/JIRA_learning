--> Jira INTRODUCTION :It is a software taht assist , tracking, reporting of project , developed by atlassian , initially started as software devlopement tool to support agile , mostly for software development teams, last few yrs adopted by all industries. it can be categorized into 3 category  as jira software ( software development and agile teams), jira service desk (IT serviec desk like helpdesk in which users raise service request and have SLA etc) , jira core (business units , highly customizable as screens and can modify roles and responsibilities of persons, if working in any HR or marketing then JIRA core will be used).

--> Issues in JIRA: issue is any task want to achieve , in order to complete a particular project . In JIRA issue is a task that team complete in order to deliver the project. Default issue types (supported would be bug, story bug task etc), JIRA core( have different task ).

5) in jira we use , users -team members, issues-task/ bug story, workflow-process for each task, version / realease- specific to development efforts and released to production, components- like database /ui , data for reporting on prject status,  


--> KANBAN software - it si a framework for agile development methodology and JIRA supports 2 types of framework one is scrum ad KANBAN , it is much more suited when there is contionous flow of work , instead of time box iterations like scrum methodology like scrum , gives flexilibility like of continous delivery , advantage is change can happen anytime , so reprioritization or change of issues can happen anytime in KANBAN,it is most suited when there is no rigid timeline .

--> diff b/w scrum and KANBAN :
Kanban and Scrum are both project management frameworks, but they differ in how they manage work and how they approach decision making: 
1) Workflow
Kanban uses a continuous workflow, while Scrum uses structured sprints. 
2) Task management
Kanban breaks down tasks into smaller chunks, while Scrum focuses on specific tasks during sprints. 
3) Decision making
Kanban uses a simple process of defining goals, mapping processes, creating cards, and setting limits. Scrum uses collaborative, team-based approaches, with key decisions made during meetings. 
4) Prioritization
Scrum prioritizes work by sorting and grooming the product backlog, setting priorities, and estimating resources. Kanban uses probabilistic forecasting instead of a prioritization or estimation scheme. 
5) Best use
Kanban is better for smaller projects or ongoing projects with small pieces of work, while Scrum is better for complex projects that need to be split into smaller chunks. 
6) Kanban can be used to supplement Scrum, or you can use a mixture of the two approaches called Scrumban.
